SheHacks Hacker Olympics Python Submission - Pauline Lee, Diya Tomar, Katelyn Chung, and Sam Yee

Our group created a program that randomly generates a number and prompts the user to guess the number until they guess correctly. Users can create ranges using negative and positive integers, and are notified to re-enter an integer when they've inputted float numbers, strings, or boolean values. Once the user has created a range, they will try to guess the randomly generated number, and the program will inform them whether they should guess higher or lower than their previous guess. The number of guesses it takes for the user to get the correct number will be revealed to the user at the end of the game.
